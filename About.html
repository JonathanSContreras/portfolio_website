                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <!-- <p>Here I will I will tell you a little about me</p> -->
                    <p>Hello there! Welcome to my little corner of the internet. My name is Jonathan Contreras, and I'm thrilled to have you here. Let me tell you a bit about myself.

                        I'm a passionate about music, computer science, and much more. I am now dedicated to focusing on getting futher into web devlopment. 
                        
                        Although I have only 1 year of experience in computer science, I've had the opportunity to work on many projects with the help of my university.
                        
                        My journey has been filled with exciting challenges and valuable learning experiences, shaping me into the person I am today.
                        
                        Beyond my professional endeavors, I'm an avid musician. It's during these moments that I often discover unexpected inspiration and fresh perspectives that fuel my creativity.
                        
                        In the upcoming Fall 2023 semester, I will be taking a Data Structures and a Database Management Systems course. 
                        
                        What truly motivates me is the chance to make a positive impact on people's lives. </p>
